# Binary Search Tree.
<br> Left subtree nodes > root
<br> Right subtree nodes < root
<br> Left and Right subtrees are also BST with no duplicates.

# Special Property
<br> Inorder traversal of a BST gives a sorted sequence.

# Strategy
<br> Most of the problem will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing into the subproblems and making recursion calls on the subtree.

# Delete a Node
<br> Case1: No Child(Leaf Node)
<br> Delete Node & Return Null to parent

<br> Case2: One Child
<br> Delete node and replace with child node.

<br> Case3: Two Children
<br> Replace value with inorder successor.
<br> Delete the node for inorder successor.
