# Graph
<br> Graph is a network of nodes.
<br> Edge- connect two nodes.
<br> Application - Maps, Social Network, Delivery Network.

#Sorting a graph
<br> Adjacency List.
<br> Adjacency Matrix.
<br> Edge List.
<br> 2D Matrix(Implicit Graph)

#Adjacency List
<br> multiple ways to create adjacency list like array of arrayList or hashMap.
<br> eg. 0 ----> (0,2) , 1--->(0,3)
<br> Adjacency list doses not use extra space.
<br> No extra space -- time optimised.

#Adjacency Matrix
<br> Use extra space.
<br> V = vertex.
<br> space complexity O(V^2)
<br> Time complexity O(V)

#Edge List
<br> Edges = {(0,2),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)}
<br> Used in minimum spanning tree algorithm.

#Graph Traversal
<br> Breath first search(BFS) -- Go to immediate neighbour first.
<br> use Queue data structure for BFS.

<br> Depth first search(DFS)--- keep going to the first neighbour.

#Cyle Detection(Directed Graph)
<br> Use modified DSF code for directed graph cycle detection.

#Topological Sorting
<br> Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no cycles.
<br> Topological sorting is used only for DAGs (not for non-DAGs).
<br> It is a linear order of vertices such that every directed edge u--->v.
<br> The vertex u comes before v in the order.

#Cycle in Graph
<br> undirected graph----DFS
<br>                     BFS
<br>                     DSU(Disjoint set union)
<br> Directed Graph -----DFS
<br>                     BFS
<br>                     Topological Sorting(kahn's Algori

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
<br> Dijkstra's algorithm used to find out the shortest distance between two nodes.
<br> Time Complexity - O(V + log E)

# Bellman Ford Algorithm:
<br> Used to find out the shortest distance between two nodes.
<br> Dijkstra's algorithm fails to find the shortest distance between the two nodes with negative edge weight.
<br> Time Complexity of the Bellman Ford algorithm is more than the Dijkstra's algorithm.
<br> Time Complexity O(V * E).

# Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)
<br> A minimum spanning tree(MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weight undirected graph
<br> that connects all the vertices together, without any cycle and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# Minimum Spanning Tree
<br> A minimum spanning tree(MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weight undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycle with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# Strongly Connected Component
<br> SCC is a component in which we can reach every vertex of the component from every other vertex in that component.
<br> Only works on directed graph.

# Kosaraju's Algorithm:
<br> Time complexity: O(V + E)
<br> Algorithm:
<br> Get nodes in stack(topological sort)
<br> Transpose the graph.
<br> Do DFS according to stack nodes on the transpose graph.
